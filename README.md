**RELOCATED**

*PLEASE NOTE:*

*This project has been relocated to the fork at [https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted) and all further development will take place on that fork.*

*Apologies for any inconvenience - but the project had vastly outgrown its initial scope as a simple CLI (and there isn't any end 
in sight :-)) and was rapidly becoming a monster so it seemed better to relocate it to a dedicated place where it could be 
restructured and future development simplified.*

# uhppote-go

A set of cross-platform building blocks for access control systems based on the *UHPPOTE UT0311-L0x* TCP/IP 
Wiegand access control boards. Currently available:

- low level communication library
- CLI for scripting and system administration
- REST service for integration with HTTP servers and mobile clients
- *(in development) MQTT endpoint for integration with IOT systems*

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The manufacturer supplied application is 'Windows-only' and provides limited support for integration with other
systems.

## Releases

- v0.4.2: Reworked `GetDevice` REST API to use directed broadcast and added get-device to CLI
- v0.4.1: Get/set door control state functionality added to simulator, CLI and REST API
- v0.4.0: REST API service
- v0.3.1: Functional simulator with minimal command API
- v0.2.0: Load access control list from TSV file
- v0.1.0: Bare-bones but functional CLI
